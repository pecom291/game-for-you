# The Right Game For You!
Final Project Adv. Critical Comp.
This is the layout for the website "The Right Game For You", this was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
for the final project of this class.

How it works: 
On the website simply follow the button/link at the bottom that will bring you to the next page
On the next page click all the answers that apply to you and get the game ment for you!

Project: 
The prompt for this project was to create a website that represented a quiz that had up to 10 interactive parts in it 
(buttons, write in parts, etc) that were recording in local storage.

Process:
The design process for this was actually really fun! I started my idea initally by thinking about what I wanted to 
create the quiz about. My idea was to create something to help someone figure out the kind of game the person should play 
if they are running out of ideas. I started this by laying out the html and css with the javascript files just to have my base 
down. After this I created a rough outline of all three to give myself an idea of what I wanted the quiz and the website itself 
to look like. When I figured all of this out I went and checked to see what the best colors and things to include. 

After layout and color was done, I went to setting up the quiz. The quiz was a pain and did not work the way it 
was supposed to a majority of the time. I connected each response to each question to an array that is connected to local storage. The
way that this works is by checking to see the response that is submited on each button. When I was done I fixed up all the answers and
the questions and it was done!

Challenges:
I struggled with the quiz/questionnair portion of this for hours. 

Plans for this: 
Some ideas I want to continue to add to this are the links to the games, some further detailed descriptions of some of the questions
and answers. Fix the pictures that are supposed to be in the game and apparently fix the last option.
