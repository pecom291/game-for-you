    <h1>What is The Right Game for You?</h1>
    
    <p id="des">
        The Right Game for You is a website designed entirely in helping whoever the user may be,
        to find the best game for them! The link below after entering your name will take you to 
        a questionnaire, just fill it out and press submit at the bottom to know.
    </p>

    <h2>How does this work?</h2>

    <p>
        The way that this works is through the questionnaire itself. By choosing the answers you desire
        and selecting the submit button, an answer will appear at the bottom most revelant to the choices
        selected! The questions and answers themselves will have different game titles as references to help
        assist answering them (which if you don't know them is just more ideas to check out!).
    </p>

    <h2>What genres are offered here?</h2>

    <p>
        There are a total of 9 different genres of games that are possible of recieving on this site. The
        questionnaire itself uses a system to select the genre with the most similar answers amoung the questions.
    </p>

    <h2>Goal and reason behind site</h2>

    <p>
        As someone who plays video games all the time, or have played a lot growing up (nowing I'm making things like this!) I often
        struggled with finding the best game that I want to play. This is either because I can't make up my mind or I'm not 
        interested enough to check. So instead, this is designed to help the user find the games they are looking for by entering their
        name and filling out the questionnaire to get the best game for them!
    </p>
